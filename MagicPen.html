        <h2>How long does the product last?</h2>
        <p>
          It depends on how much you use it and how many times a day. One pen may last 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week... The more you use it,
          the quicker you'll see results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Magic Pen is one of the most high-tech NAIL CREAM in the world. One droplet should be enough to use for all 5
          fingernails. To avoid wasting product unnecessarily, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use the brush to spread it evenly on all 5 fingernails.</li>
          <li>Keep twisting until you can see a tiny droplet at the top of the brush. It will require a few twists the
            first time.</li>
          <li>Ensure no significant amount of cream is left over on top of the nail. If you see a considerable amount of cream on the nail, you've used too much.</li>
          <li>Rub in to allow it to penetrate entirely on the nail bed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        <h2>How long till I can see the results?</h2>
        <p>
          It depends on your nails' damage and what you want to achieve. In the first days, you will notice your cuticles are hydrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be aware that each person reacts differently to products; they will not necessarily experience the same benefits or in the same timeline. Your dietary habits, stress, health, and other characteristics can affect how fast your nails grow and heal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our experience, some customers use it once daily and notice the results within 1 week.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, customers who recently removed artificial nails, have had their nails weak for many years, have a severe
          medical
          condition, want their nails very long, or want to stop biting straight away may have to apply 3-4 times a day
          consistently for many weeks. Likewise, customers with ridges or damaged nails after chemotherapy may need more
          than
          5
          pens. It depends on how damaged your nails are and how many years they've been like this.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <figcaption><b>IMPORTANT</b></figcaption>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Avoid using artificial nails, or stop halfway through after you start using the Magic Pen. If you do that, you'll lose the progress of your treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you removed artificial nails recently, you might expect as your nails grow, the old ones will break, and the new ones will grow stronger and faster. Be patient. If that happens, the product is doing its job. File the corners of your nail to avoid it breaking any further.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not use the Magic Pen on top of other nail hardeners! The Magic Pen has everything in it. If you try to use many products for the same purpose simultaneously, none of them will work.
            </li>
            <li>If your nail is still dry after you rub it in and the product has disappeared, you might not have applied enough. In this case, use more times on top until the nails are slightly shinier. That means the product has penetrated the porous of the nail bed.</li>
          </ol>
        </figure>

      <article>
        <h2>Is it an oil? Is it a base coat?</h2>
        <p>
          It's a NAIL CREAM. Easy to apply on bare nails or with regular nail polish.
        </p>
        <p>
          It won't damage your regular nail polish after you use it.
        </p>

        <h2>Should I use it on cuticles and nails?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! Apply on both cuticles and nails. After you do, rub in until the product penetrates completely into your
          nails.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>TWIST the pen until the NAIL CREAM comes out.</li>
          <li>APPLY on the cuticles and nails at the same time. Like the Magic Pen, you've never seen such easy nail care at home.</li>
          <li>RUB IN until the nail absorbs the NAIL CREAM completely.</li>
          <li>SMELL it! The fragrance is like heaven!!!!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Most customers can observe significant cuticle reduction after the constant use of 2-3 pens.

        <h2>Does it treat fungus? What about toenails?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, the product can prevent and treat fungus as a side-effect of its cosmetic properties.<br>
          Customers are sharing excellent results after applying on their toes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Did you know?</b><br>
          Toenails may take one year to grow!<br>
          After using the Magic Pen, customers have new toenails after 2-3 months when they apply it several times a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>WARNING</b><br>
          DO NOT share the same brush with other fingernails so the fungus can't spread!
        </p>

      <article>
        <h2>Can I use it on top of my nail colour?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Magic Pen has exclusive technology with a high absorption rate. Therefore, you can use it on top of your
          nail
          colour. However, it doesn't work on top of solid adhesives, such as the superglue of SNS and other kinds of
          artificial
          nails.
        </p>
        <p>
          It won't damage your regular nail polish after you use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maximise the results, apply on the bare nails without colour. For example, suppose your nails are damaged or peeling off, or you've recently removed artificial nails. In that case, using the product on your bare nails 3-4 times a day for a week is better. Later, you can apply it on top of your favourite colour once a day.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h2>Do I have to wait for it to dry? Why is it "instant dry"?</h2>
        <p>
          The product is a NAIL CREAM with a high absorption rate technology.<br>
          It means you don't have to wait for it dry after applying.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be applied on top of bare nails or over regular lacquer!<br>
          Yes, you don't need to stop using your favourite colour.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you rub in, the nails and cuticles absorb the product completely. You don't need to wait for it to dry like gel or nail polish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>
            Does not work over dip powder, acrylic, or other artificial nails. Apply in the gap between the artificial nail and the cuticles if you want to use it while wearing artificial nails; only the effect will be reduced.

        <h2>For how long should I use the product?</h2>
        <p>The Magic Pen is supposed to be used as a <strong>skincare</strong> product. Do you have any skincare routine?
          It's
          the same, only that you should introduce the Magic Pen in that routine. Think of <strong>nail care.</strong></p>
        <p>
          After you've used the Magic Pen for a while and your nails are not damaged anymore, you can start using the
          Magic
          Pen
          only once a day or once every 2 days to maintain the nail healthier in the long run. You don't have to use it
          every
          day if the nails are not weak or damaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember to keep the product besides you. You can use it before sleeping, in the morning before starting your
          daily
          routine, and throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples: bedside table, computer or near your skincare products.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Store the pen in a cool place away from light.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>How much should I use on each application?</h2>
        <p>
          Don't apply a massive amount at once. Consistency is the key!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you notice cream left at the top of your nails after applying and rubbing in, you're overusing it. The product should disappear after you rub it in.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you apply too much cream at once, the results won't improve significantly. It's like any other cream or skincare product: you need a few hours for the product to act in your nails before you can apply it again.
        </p>
        <p>
          After your nails are beautiful, use the Magic Pen when you feel the need. If your cuticles are dry, use it to make them hydrated. It depends on your body, but for most customers, it should be fine to use sporadically after the first boost as long as you don't stop using the product for a long time.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Keep using it multiple times a day:</figcaption>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Before you leave home
            </li>
            <li>
              At night before bed
            </li>
            <li>
              On your lunch break
            </li>
            <li>
              On the bus on the way to appointments
            </li>
            <li>
              On the plane for that fantastic trip
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I'm confident you can squeeze your nail care routine during your day. Think smart; leave the Magic Pen in a place to remember to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure your nails remain strong. It's a lifestyle change!

        <h2>My nails are very damaged. How many times a day should I use it?</h2>
        <p>
          Think about skincare!<br>
          How do you look after your hair and skin?<br>
          Why not care for your nails daily after work, after looking after kids, cleaning your house or sanitising your hands all day?
        </p>
        <p>
          For damaged nails, it's better to apply multiple times a day for the first few weeks.<br>
          Apply at least 2-3 times a day for ridges, artificial nail removal, trauma, and splitting nails.<br>
          It also depends on your body and health habits; your results can be rapid or take a bit longer.

        <h2>Can I use it on top of SNS?</h2>
        <p>
          Not on top, but you can still use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main component of SNS is <strong>super glue</strong> (<a
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Cyanoacrylate">Cyanoacrylate</a>). According to Nail Expert <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alison-bowhill-hayes-269469a1">Alison Bowhill Hayes</a>, "SNS is a super
          glue that's applied to nails and then dipped into a polymer (acrylic powder)" (<a
            href="https://www.beautycrew.com.au/everything-you-need-to-know-about-sns-nails">source</a>). No treatment can
          penetrate through such a strong adhesive.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you can still use the Magic Pen for cuticle hydration and in the gap between your cuticle and SNS. That
          will make your nails grow faster, though not with the same efficiency. If you try to use it on top of SNS, it
          won't penetrate.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I wash my hands?</h2>
        <p>
          Many customers have cleaner jobs or religious requirements to wash their hands frequently. All of them have
          noticed results without significantly affecting their routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The product is a <strong>NAIL CREAM</strong>, so it doesn't create a hard layer on top of your nails. Due to its high
          absorption rate, the Magic Pen penetrates deeply into the nail bed in minutes. Therefore, washing your hands many minutes after applying the product won't wear out. However, we recommend using the Magic Pen <b>after</b> you wash your hands, not immediately before, to ensure maximum effectiveness.
