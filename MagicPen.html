        <h2>How long does the product last?</h2>
        <p>
          One pen lasts up to 3 weeks if you apply once a day, half that time if you use it twice a day, and so forth. The
          more you use, the quicker you'll see results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Magic Pen is one of the most high-tech NAIL CREAMS in the world. One droplet should be enough to use for all 5
          fingernails. To avoid wasting product unnecessarily, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use the brush to spread it evenly in all 5 fingernails.</li>
          <li>Keep twisting until you can see a tiny droplet at the top of the brush. It will require a few twists on the
            first time.</li>
          <li>Ensure there's not a significant amount of cream leftover on top of the nail. If you can see a considerable
            amount of cream on the nail, that means you used too much.</li>
          <li>Rub in to allow it to penetrate entirely on the nail bed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <br>
          If you want to use more than once a day or your nails are significantly damaged, we recommend the <a

        <h2>How long till I can see results?</h2>
        <p>
          It depends on how damaged your nails are and what you want to achieve. In the first days, you will notice your
          cuticles hydrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be aware that each person reacts differently to products; they will not necessarily experience the same benefits
          or
          in
          the same timeline. Things like your dietary habits, stress, health, and other individual characteristics can
          affect
          how fast your nails grow and heal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our experience, there are customers who use it once a day and notice the results within 1 week.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, customers who recently removed artificial nails, have their nails weak for many years, have a serious
          medical
          condition, want their nails very long, or want to stop biting straight away may have to apply 3-4 times a day
          consistently for many weeks. Likewise, customers with ridges or damaged nails after chemotherapy may need more
          than
          5
          pens. It depends on how damaged your nails are and how many years they've been like this.
        </p>

          <figcaption><b>IMPORTANT</b></figcaption>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Avoid using artificial nails or stop halfway through after you start using the Magic Pen. If you do that, you'll lose the progress of your treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you removed artificial nails recently, you might expect, as your nails grow, the old one will break, and the new one will grow stronger and faster. Be patient. If that happens, the product is doing its job. File the corners of your nail to avoid it breaking any further.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not use the Magic Pen on top of other nail hardeners! The Magic Pen has everything in it. If you try to use many products for the same purpose simultaneously, none of them will work.
            </li>
            <li>If you nail is still dry after you rub in and the product has disappeared, it means you might have not applied enough. In this case, apply more times on top until nails are slightly shinier. That means the product has penetrated the porous of the nail bed.</li>
          </ol>

      <article>
        <h2>Is it an oil? Is it a base coat?</h2>
        <p>
          It's a NAIL CREAM. Easy to apply on bare nails or with normal nail polish.
        </p>
        <p>
          It won't damage your normal nail polish after you use it.
        </p>

        <h2>Should I use it on cuticles and nails?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! Apply on both cuticles and nails. After you do, rub in until the product penetrates completely into your
          nails.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>TWIST the pen until the NAIL CREAM comes out.</li>
          <li>APPLY on the cuticles and nails at the same time. You've never seen such an easy nail care at home like the Magic Pen.</li>
          <li>RUB IN until the nail absorb the NAIL CREAM completely.</li>
          <li>SMELL it! The fragrance is like a heaven!!!!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Most customers can observe significant cuticle reduction after the constant use of 2-3 pens.

        <h2>Does it treat fungus? What about toenails?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, as a side-effect of its cosmetic properties, the product can prevent and treat fungus.<br>
          Customers are sharing amazing results after applying on toes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Did you know?</b><br>
          Toenails may take one year to grow!<br>
          After using the Magic Pen, customers have new toe nails after 2-3 months when they apply the Magic Pen several times a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>WARNING</b><br>
          DO NOT share the same brush with other fingernails so that the fungus can't spread!

        <h2>Can I use it on top of my nail colour?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Magic Pen has exclusive technology with a high absorption rate. Therefore, you can use it on top of your
          nail
          colour. However, it doesn't work on top of solid adhesives, such as the superglue of SNS and other kinds of
          artificial
          nails.
        </p>
        <p>
          It won't damage your normal nail polish after you use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maximize the results, apply on the bare nails without colour. For example, if your nails are damaged, say
          they're peeling off, or you've recently removed artificial nails, it's better to use the product on your bare
          nails 3-4 times
          a day for a week. Later, you can apply on top of your favourite colour once a day.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h2>Do I have to wait for it to dry? Why is it "instant dry"?</h2>
        <p>
          The product is a NAIL CREAM with a high absorption rate technology.<br>
          It means you don't have to wait for it dry after applying.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be applied on top of bare nails or over normal lacquer!<br>
          Yes, you don't need to stop using you favourite colour.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you rub in, the nails and cuticles absorb the product completely. You don't need to wait for it to dry like a gel or nail polish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>
            Does not work over dip powder, acrylic, and other kinds of artificial nails. Apply in the gap between the artificial nail and the cuticles if you want to use while wearing artificial nails, only the effect will be reduced.

        <h2>For how long should I use the product?</h2>
        <p>The Magic Pen is supposed to be used as a <strong>skincare</strong> product. Do you have any skincare routine?
          It's
          the same, only that you should introduce the Magic Pen in that routine. Think of <strong>nail care.</strong></p>
        <p>
          After you've used the Magic Pen for a while and your nails are not damaged anymore, you can start using the
          Magic
          Pen
          only once a day or once every 2 days to maintain the nail healthier in the long run. You don't have to use it
          every
          day if they're not weak or damaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember to keep the product beside you. You can use it before sleeping, in the morning before starting your
          daily
          routine, and throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples: bedside table, computer or near your skincare products.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Store the pen in a cool place away from light.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h2>How much should I use on each application?</h2>
        <p>
          Don't apply a huge amount at once. Consistency is the key!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you notice cream left at the top of your nails after you apply and rub in, then you're overusing it. The
          product
          should disappear after you rub in.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you apply too much product at a single time, the results won't improve significantly. It's like any other cream or skincare product: you need a few hours for the product to act in your nails before you can apply it again.
        </p>
        <p>
          After your nails are beautiful, use the Magic Pen when you feel the need. If your cuticles are dry, use it to make them hydrated. It depends on your body, but for most customers it should be fine to use sporadically after the first boost as long as you don't stop using the product for a long time.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>Keep using it multiple times a day:</figcaption>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Before you leave home
            </li>
            <li>
              At night before bed
            </li>
            <li>
              On your lunch break
            </li>
            <li>
              On the bus on the way to appointments
            </li>
            <li>
              On the plane for that amazing trip
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I'm confident you can squeeze your nail care routine during your day. Think smart, leave the Magic Pen in a place to remember to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure your nails remain strong. It's a lifestyle change!

        <h2>My nails are very damaged. How many times a day should I use?</h2>
        <p>
          Think about skincare!<br>
          How do you look after your hair and skin?<br>
          Why not care of you nails everyday after work, after looking after kids, cleaning your house or sanitising your hands all day long?
        </p>
        <p>
          For damaged nails, it's better to apply multiple times a day for the first few weeks.<br>
          For ridges, fake nails removal, nail trauma, and splitting nails, please apply for at least 2-3 times a day.<br>
          It also depends on your body and health habits; your results can be very quick or take a bit longer.

        <h2>Can I use it on top of SNS?</h2>
        <p>
          Not on top, but you can still use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main component of SNS is <strong>super glue</strong> (<a
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Cyanoacrylate">Cyanoacrylate</a>). According to Nail Expert <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alison-bowhill-hayes-269469a1">Alison Bowhill Hayes</a>, "SNS is a super
          glue that's applied to nails and then dipped into a polymer (acrylic powder)" (<a
            href="https://www.beautycrew.com.au/everything-you-need-to-know-about-sns-nails">source</a>). No treatment can
          penetrate through such strong adhesive.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you can still use the Magic Pen for cuticle hydration and in the gap between your cuticle and SNS. That
          will make your nails grow faster, though not with the same efficiency. If you try to use it on top of SNS, it
          won't penetrate.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I wash my hands?</h2>
        <p>
          Many customers have cleaner jobs or religious requirements to wash their hands frequently. All of them have
          noticed results without significantly affecting their routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The product is a <strong>NAIL CREAM</strong>, so it doesn't create a hard layer on top of your nails. Due to its high
          absorption rate, the Magic Pen penetrates very deep into the nail bed in a matter of minutes. For that reason,
          if you wash your hands many minutes after applying the product, it won't wear out. However, we recommend using
          the Magic Pen <b>after</b> you wash your hands, not immediately before, to ensure maximum effectiveness.
